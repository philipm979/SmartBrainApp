# SmartBrain App 
* A fully responsive SmartBrain App built using React and NodeJS as part of Andrei Neagoie's ZeroToMastery course 'The Complete Web Developer'. I thoroughly enjoyed building this app as it helped me to 'connect the dots' between the front-end and back-end. 
* Technologies used:
  * React
  * NodeJS
  * Express
  * PostgreSQL
