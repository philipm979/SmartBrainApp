# SmartBrain App 
* A fully responsive SmartBrain App built using React and NodeJS as part of Andrei Neagoie's ZeroToMastery course 'The Complete Web Developer'. I thoroughly enjoyed building this app as it helped me to 'connect the dots' between the front-end and back-end. 
* **This repo contains the front-end code only, please [click here](https://github.com/philipm979/SmartBrain-API) for the back-end repo.**
* Technologies used for Front-End:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front-End Javascript Library
  * [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) - CSS Toolkit
